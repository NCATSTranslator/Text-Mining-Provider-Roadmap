# NCATS Text Mining Provider Roadmap
This repository serves as a centralized location for organizing and tracking the development of the NCATS Translator Text Mining Provider. The Text Mining Provider aims to provide an up-to-date, Biolink-compatible, knowledge graph composed of assertions mined from the available full-text biomedical literature as well as a knowledge graph based on the cooccurrence of pairs of concepts in the biomedical literature, scored using a suite of different cooccurrence metrics.


Available Knowledge Graphs | Description
-------------------------- | -----------
[Targeted text-mined association KG](https://github.com/NCATSTranslator/Text-Mining-Provider-Roadmap/blob/master/README_assoc_kgs.md) | a KG of Biolink associations extracted from scientific text
[Concept cooccurrence KG](https://github.com/NCATSTranslator/Text-Mining-Provider-Roadmap/blob/master/README_cooccur_kgs.md) | a KG linking concepts that cooccur in scientific text, scored at different levels, e.g. title, sentence, document, using a suite of cooccurrence metrics


## Feature requests and issues
The Text Mining Provider aims to serve the needs of the NCATS Translator community, and thus development efforts are prioritized based on community input and feedback. If you have a specific target you would like the Text Mining Provider to address, or would like to report a text mining error [please submit an issue to this repository](https://github.com/NCATSTranslator/Text-Mining-Provider-Roadmap/issues/new/choose).
